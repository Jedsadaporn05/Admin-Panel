# Project
Mini Project : I have made an e-commerce admin panel (CRUD). In this project, there will be a shop page. For displaying product information such as images, names, details, and product prices And in the Login section for Role Admin to update, edit, or manage the product section that will be displayed on the shop page. It will work together with the SSMS database.
